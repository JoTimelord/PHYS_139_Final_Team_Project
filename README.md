# PHYS 139 Final Team Project

### Authors: William Scott, Leo (Qiyu) Liu, Nani Kang, Yuntong Zhou

## Project Statement

Given a dataset (x1,x2,x3...xN) generated by two Poisson distributions of different rate parameters, determine the time (n0) at which the change of 
parameter took place.

## Project Method

Gibbs Sampling

## Contributions

Will: Structured the final2.py file 

Nani: Plot customization, n0 initial value variation code & analysis

Leo: update and improve on the main function and implemented the function for calculating lambda1 and lambda2, partc graph and partd mean; Debugging; 3D animation of walking process

Yuntong: Analysis Note (including part A); n0 sampling function; Surfaceplot function; Debugging


### Slides division
